## Entry For Mall Directory

### Reflection
---
#### Context:
This is the Mall Directory project. This project is designed to help the user Navigate in the Fulton Mall in which it can be very messy at times scrolling through lists and lists of different malls and their category. Originally we thought about making this project so that the user can click on a number and automatically directs them to a certain store/ category but we (my team: Gerard and Anthea) realized that it wasn't efficent at all. <br>

#### Challenges & Next Steps 
The process has been rough with ups and downs, but the most difficult thing that we encountered and still encountering is making a local scope into a global scope so that it displays when the user types in what category they want to go into. We have managed to figure out the first part. However, we are still trying to figure out how to make it so that it isn't undefined but matches the store category name instead. Our next steps are including more CSS details to make this look more visually appealing and fix our 'undefined' issue.
